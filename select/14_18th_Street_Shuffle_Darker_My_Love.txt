Pigeon messenger
Got me off the plane
Says do you even know your name?
And when's the last time that you've changed?

Withering a ball
The chain it's got you on
I've been pregnant twice before
And you'll be the next in line. Hey!

In the row, see a marking
And your whole world is a round head
And he see's it all too plain
Sun glass on a mouse
By his name

A landing on the ground
Shook me out of grease
A bee was circling the hand
It's on north 400 grand

The pigeon messenger
Said I looked to thin
Must be thick to disagree
So I joined the soup on hill row
But it gets cold

There's a wall with the fallen
And I put your name right on the side
And I've lived it all too plain
S romantic ties to LA

Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
Is it good to come around?
