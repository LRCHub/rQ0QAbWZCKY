You kiss me good morning and you kiss me goodnight
You're the first thing I see when I open my eyes
Baby, I love that, sure do
But don't wanna wear out that tune

I'm emotionally complicated
All I'm sayin' is I can go from

I'll always love you, and you're still the one to
Before he cheats and ready to run, I'm
In love with the boy, but this one's for the girls
Between stand by your man and goodbye, earl
My country playlist is real persuasive
Boy, you're in trouble
My heart's on shuffle, babe

I might fall to pieces, sip some strawberry wine
Call me patsy crazy 'cause any man of mine
He better love that, that's right
'Cause I'm kind of like that tonight

I'm emotionally complicated
All I'm sayin' is I can go from

I'll always love you, and you're still the one to
Before he cheats and ready to run, I'm
In love with the boy, but this one's for the girls
Between stand by your man and goodbye, earl
My country playlist is real persuasive
Boy, you're in trouble
My heart's on shuffle, babe

That's right
You know it is, woo!

Heads, Carolina
Tails, California
Every three minutes
Got another girl for ya

I can go from I'll always love you, and you're still the one to
Before he cheats and ready to run, I'm
How do I live to gunpowder and lead
Oh, I'm hell on heels, man, I feel like a woman
In love with the boy, but this one's for the girls

Between stand by your man and goodbye, earl
My country playlist Is real persuasive
Boy, you're in trouble
My heart's on shuffle, babe
