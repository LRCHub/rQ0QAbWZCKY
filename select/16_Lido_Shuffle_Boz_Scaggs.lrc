[00:06.76] Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack
[00:13.22] But that was all he missed, and he ain't comin' back
[00:19.95] At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car, he made a stop
[00:26.62] Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
[00:49.12] 
[00:33.78] Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll
[00:40.62] He said, "One more job oughta get it
[00:44.15] One last shot 'fore we quit it
[00:50.08] One for the road"
[00:58.58] 
[00:54.34] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
[01:00.10] He's for the money, he's for the show
[01:04.45] Lido's a-waitin' for the go
[01:08.16] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[01:14.31] He said, "One more job oughta get it
[01:18.28] One last shot 'fore we quit it
[01:22.07] One more for the road"
[01:33.07] 
[01:30.49] Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun until he got the note
[01:36.72] Saying, "Tow the line or blow it," and that was all she wrote
[01:43.71] He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the border line, goin' for broke
[01:50.53] Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it
[01:54.30] This joint, ain't nothin' to it
[02:00.16] One more for the road"
[02:11.16] 
[02:04.43] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
[02:11.03] He's for the money, he's for the show
[02:14.55] Lido's a-waitin' for the go
[02:18.10] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:24.71] "One more job oughta get it
[02:28.15] One last shot, then we quit it
[02:31.70] One more for the road"
[02:42.70] 
[03:13.85] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
[03:20.42] He's for the money, he's for the show
[03:23.87] Lido's a-waitin' for the go
[03:27.32] Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[03:34.13] "One more job oughta get it"
