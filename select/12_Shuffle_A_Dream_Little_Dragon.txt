You cruise around in your deluxe water craft
And play and pickin' designer shades, don't deny class
And the girls that you know want it mighty bad
They want your kids in a row
They'll be lining up fast to your door
So make a move, castle in the sky
Pick and choose
If you want him, would you share?
Cause that's the deal, girl.
Tricklin' coins
Makin' a noise
Follow it blind
Follow the signs
Why would you want?
Someone so vain
Stealin' your soul
Lookin' at rain
You act supreme as your fortune lit the sky
But it's a shell with a crack and you're just a plain guy
Play a pill 'cause the world made it easy to
I see the shimmering rocks moving closer to you
To your door, so make a move
Castle in the sky, pick and choose
If you want it, girl, could you share?
Cause that's the deal, if you dare, so
