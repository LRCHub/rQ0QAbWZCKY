Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle

Make your life sweet with the people you meet
Do the sugar shuffle
Get some honey forget the money
Do the sugar shuffle
Creeping about like a cat in the city
Looking around for the big town kitty
Hey hey

Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle

Working all day till the night time's falling
Making your way where the lights are calling
Hey hey, hey hey

Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle

Make your life sweet with the people you meet
Do the sugar shuffle
Get some honey forget the money
Do the sugar shuffle
Round and aroung till your head is spinning
Losing the candy you should be winning
Hey hey, hey hey

Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle
Ooh do the sugar shuffle
